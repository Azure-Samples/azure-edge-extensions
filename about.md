# About the Azure Edge Extensions

Azure Edge Extensions is a suite of software tools designed to help you take full advantage of the power of Azure's
edge computing platforms. From notebook playgrounds, to CI/CD, to model transpilers, to production ready IaC, Azure
Edge Extensions are all built with the goal of composition in mind. Fork and integrate the elements you need, and see
your solutions come to life.

## Project Goals

The Azure Edge Extensions Project aims to be a highly curated list of small, composable tools that can accelerate edge
solution development. The tools curated by this project are semi-ephemeral, meaning that they will only remain on the
index as long as there is community interest in the tool. When interests subside, tools will be archived for a period of
6 months before being full retired. This lifecycle approach will allow the index to keep pace with the ever increasing
pace of innovation in edge computing, and stay in step with Azure edge platform evolution. 

## The Team

The Azure Edge Extensions team is staffed by Microsoft customer facing software engineers and technical specialists. Day in and day out we help
Microsoft customers build high scale edge computing systems at the forefront of innovation. We have first hand experience
with complex business domains, designing for the most stringent operational environments and hope that these tools and solutions
accelerate your path to ROI.
