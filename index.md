# Azure Edge Extensions

Azure Edge Extensions is a suite of software solutions designed to help you take full advantage of the power of Azure's
edge computing platforms. From notebook playgrounds, to CI/CD, to model transpilers, to production ready IaC, Azure
Edge Extensions are all built with the goal of composition in mind. Fork and integrate the elements you need, and see
your solutions come to life.

## Design Philosophy

Azure Edge Extensions are all built with the same basic principles, echoing the Unix Philosophy:

* Solve one, narrow business problem really well
* Code for contributions, not machine optimization
* Use well defined interfaces that enable composition
* Create a reaction for every action
* Output is always human readable and machine parsable

## Getting Started

All Azure Edge Extensions follow a common naming convention and use repository tags so you know what technologies are in
the box. The two primary template formats are:

* `azure-edge-extensions-{product}-{process}-{technology}`
* `azure-edge-extensions-{technology}-{platform}`

Some examples are:

* `azure-edge-extensions-aio-iac-terraform` - Azure IoT Operations Infrastructure as Code written in Terraform
* `azure-edge-extensions-polyglotnotebooks-aio` - a Polyglot Notebook for Azure IoT Operations
* `azure-edge-extensions-devcontainer-aksee` - A Dev Container with AKS Edge Essentials preinstalled

To see all the available Azure Edge Extensions, just do a [GitHub search for 'azure-edge-extensions'](https://github.com/search?q=azure-edge-extensions+in%3Aname&type=Repositories&org%3AAzureSamples).

# Contributing Tools

If you want to contribute your own tool, just make a repository following the design philosophy and naming convention above.

That's it. 

If you need help with a name for your tool or have questions about the Azure Edge Extensions project, just file an [issue](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-edge-extensions/issues) and we'll come give a hand!
