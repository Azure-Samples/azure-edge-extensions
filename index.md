# Azure Edge Extensions

Azure Edge Extensions is a suite of sample software tools and solutions designed to help you take full advantage of the power of Azure's
edge computing platforms. From notebook playgrounds, to CI/CD, to model transpilers, to production ready IaC, Azure
Edge Extensions are all built with the goal of composition in mind. Fork and integrate the elements you need, and see
your solutions come to life.

## Design Philosophy

Azure Edge Extensions are all built with the same basic principles, echoing the Unix Philosophy:

* Solve one, narrow business problem really well
* Code for contributions, not machine optimization
* Use well defined interfaces that enable composition
* Create a reaction for every action
* Output is always human readable and machine parsable

## Tools and Solutions

|  Area  |  Name (Repo Link)  |  Description  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  Exploration  |  [Azure IoT Operations through Polyglot Notebooks](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-edge-extensions-polyglotnotebook-aio)  |  Polyglot Notebooks that demonstrate how to use Azure IoT Operations using Codespaces  |
|  Dev Loop  |  [K3D Debugging Dev Container for Azure IoT Operations](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-edge-extensions-aio-dapr-net-devcontainer-k3d)  |  Azure IoT Operations (AIO) debugging dev container with k3d and DAPR  |
|  Dev Loop  |  [IoT Edge Object Model](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-edge-extensions-iotedge-objectmodel-dotnet)  |  This library provides extensions methods of azure-iot-sdk. The object model supplies a common API to view and edit deployment manifests regardless of whether they originate from an At-Scale or single device deployment  |
|  IAC  |  [Terraform for Azure IoT Operations](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-edge-extensions-aio-iac-terraform)  |  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Terraform for Azure IoT Operations (AIO) components. Includes initial infrastructure setup through Terraform  |
|  Operations  |  [IoT Edge Deployment Engine (.NET)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-edge-extensions-iotedge-deploymentengine-dotnet)  |  Deployment engine that provides enhanced experience and flexibility for the Azure IoT Edge deployment processes  |
|  ML/AI  |  [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Azure IoT Operations](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-edge-extensions-retrieval-augmented-generation)  |  A sample RAG solution for AKS-EE and Azure IoT Operations  |
|  Data Modeling  |  [ADT Transpiler](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-edge-extensions-adt-transpiler) |  Code-first transpiler to DTDL  |
